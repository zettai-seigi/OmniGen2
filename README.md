## Introduction
**OmniGen2** is a powerful and efficient generative model. Unlike OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. OmniGen2 has competitive performance across four primary capabilities:

- **Visual Understanding**: Inherits the robust ability to interpret and analyze image content from its Qwen-VL-2.5 foundation.
- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Creates high-fidelity and aesthetically pleasing images from textual prompts.
- **Instruction-guided Image Editing**: Executes complex, instruction-based image modifications with high precision, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.
- **In-context Generation**: A versatile capability to process and flexibly combine diverse inputs‚Äîincluding humans, reference objects, and scenes‚Äîto produce novel and coherent visual outputs.

As an open-source project, OmniGen2 provides a powerful yet resource-efficient foundation for researchers and developers exploring the frontiers of controllable and personalized generative AI.

**We will release the training code and dataset. Stay tuned!**

## üí° Usage Tips
To achieve optimal results with OmniGen2, you can adjust the following key hyperparameters based on your specific use case.
- `text_guidance_scale`: Controls how strictly the output adheres to the text prompt (Classifier-Free Guidance).
- `image_guidance_scale`: This controls how much the final image should resemble the input reference image.
    - **The Trade-off**: A higher value makes the output more faithful to the reference image's structure and style, but it might ignore parts of your text prompt. A lower value (~1.5) gives the text prompt more influence.
    - **Tip**: For image editing task, we recommend to set it between 1.2 and 2.0; for in-context generateion task, a higher image_guidance_scale will maintian more details in input images, and we recommend to set it between 2.5 and 3.0.
- `max_pixels`: Automatically resizes images when their total pixel count (width √ó height) exceeds this limit, while maintaining its aspect ratio. This helps manage performance and memory usage.
  - **Tip**: Default value is 1024*1024. You can reduce this value if you encounter memory issues.
- `max_input_image_side_length`: Maximum side length for input images.
- `negative_prompt`: Tell the model what you don't want to see in the image.
    - **Example**: blurry, low quality, text, watermark
    - **Tip**: For the best results, try experimenting with different negative prompts. If you're not sure, just use the default negative prompt.
- `enable_model_cpu_offload`: **Reduces VRAM usage by nearly 50% with a negligible impact on speed**.
  - This is achieved by offloading the model weights to CPU RAM when they are not in use.
  - See: [Model Offloading](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/memory#model-offloading)
- `enable_sequential_cpu_offload`: Minimizes VRAM usage to less than 3GB, but at the cost of significantly slower performance.
  - This works by offloading the model in submodules and loading them onto the GPU sequentially as needed.
  - See: [CPU Offloading](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/memory#cpu-offloading)
- `cfg_range_start`, `cfg_range_end`: Define the timestep range where CFG is applied. Per this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07724), reducing `cfg_range_end` can significantly decrease inference time with a negligible impact on quality.
  
**Some suggestions for improving generation quality:**
1. Use High-Quality Images
  - Provide clear images, preferably with a resolution **greater than 512√ó512 pixels**.
  - Small or blurry inputs will result in low-quality outputs.
2. Be Specific with Instructions
  - Clearly describe both **what to change** and **how you want it changed**.
  - For in-context generation tasks, explicitly state which elements should come from which image. For example, instead of "Add bird to desk", say "Add the bird from image 1 onto the desk in image 2."
3. Prioritize English
The model currently performs best with **English** prompts.


## ‚ùå Limitations
The current model sometimes does not follow instructions. You can increase the "Number of images per prompt" to generate multiple images at once, so you can choose the result you are satisfied with, or try different prompts. In our own experience, being as detailed as possible tends to work better.

The current model cannot decide the output image size by itself; the default size is 1024√ó1024. You need to set a specific size if you require a different one. When you input an image, we will set the output size to match the input image (this works best for editing tasks). If you want to modify just one image out of several, you should also set the output size to match the image you want to edit; otherwise, it may lead to low-quality outputs.

## üíª Resources Requirement
OmniGen2 natively requires an **NVIDIA RTX 3090** or an equivalent GPU with approximately **17GB of VRAM**. For devices with less VRAM, you can enable **CPU Offload** to run the model.

**Performance Tip**: To improve inference speed, consider decreasing the `cfg_range_end` parameter. Within a reasonable range, this has a negligible impact on output quality.
